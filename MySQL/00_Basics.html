            <strong>DBMS(Database Management System) :</strong> It is software that allows users to create, manage, and
            access database.
            It provides a structured way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data, ensuring data consistency, security,
            and integrity across multiple user and applications.

            <strong>CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete.</strong> These are the four
            basic operations that
            can be performed on data stored in a database or other persistent storage. They are fundamental to how
            applications interact with and manage data.

            <strong>A Relational Database Management System(RDBMS) :</strong> is a software system that manages
            relational databases,
            which store data in tables with rows and columns.
            => RDBMS provides functionalities to create, update, and administer these database, often using
            SQL(Structured Query Language) to interact with the data.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>A NoSQL database(often referred to as "Not Only SQL")</strong> is a type of databse management
            system that differ from traditional relational(SQL) database by handling unstructured and semi-structured data with more flexibility and scalability. Instead of using a fixed schema and tables like SQL databases, NoSQL databases
            offer various data models like key-value, document, column-family, and graph, making them suitable for
            diverse data types and large-scale applications.
